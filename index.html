  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
    <div class="row">
    <p>Hello, I'm Richard Tirado a Junior at Pasadena High School. I currently am the appointed Treasurer of the Class of 2019 Club, as Treasurer I attend almost every fundraising event, count the money and submit it to the clubs account at School. I also actively volunteer at Huntington Memorial Hospital, working with nurses and patients in Station 45 (Post Surgical floor). 
Answering patients call and secretaries phone. Assist visitors by giving the location of patients. Responding to nursing requests and discharges patients by providing wheelchair accompaniment of patients to an area of the hospital. In this area of work, you must always keep a smile on your face at all times. During the summer I got accepted to participate in a competitive and collaborative program called the Pre-Med Summer Scholars Program at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. With all this volunteering I plan to find my passion in a particular part of Medicine from being a Pediatrician to a Surgent.
