    <h2>What technology has in store for humanity</h2>
  <div class="column" id="descriptioncol">This project was an essay on how technology can affect our future. This essay is based on information such as novels and articles gathered throughout the school year. This exciting topic was given to the 10th grade English Honors Class, and it gave me a deeper understanding of technology and how writers from years and years ago can foretell a future. That future is slowly becoming a reality in my lifetime. The hardest part of this project was gathering and suitably organizing my information.
